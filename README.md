# 👨‍💻 Julian Hecker — [@julian-hecker](https://github.com/julian-hecker/)
Good morning! I'm Julian, a developer and curious guy from Long Island, NY. 

- 📚 I'm finishing up my degree in Computer Programming at Farmingdale State College. I'm also the founder of the Tech Club here.
- 💻 I'm currently working as a Full Stack Developer at [Sucoweb](https://www.sucoweb.com/). I spend all day researching and solving problems with clients' sites.
- 🚧 [Barbago](https://github.com/barbago) is my personal project, which I hope to make into a great startup!
